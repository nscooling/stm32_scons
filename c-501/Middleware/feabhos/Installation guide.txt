FEABHOS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=================================

FeabhOS is a Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL) designed to give a common API for teaching core operating system, and real-time programming, concepts.  As such, FeabhOS is not designed to be an all-encompasing OSAL, but it does contain enough elements to be practical and useful in production code.


File Organisation
-----------------

FeabhOS is structured as follows:

feabhOS
-- C              These folders contain the C API
   -- common      User constructs
      -- inc      Header files

   -- <PLATFORM>  Platform-specific implementation (currently Win32 and FreeRTOS)
      -- inc	  OS-specific definitions
      -- src      OS-specific implementations

-- C++		  These folders contain the C++ API
   -- inc         Header files (and template classes)
   -- src         Class implementations


NOTE:  The C++ implementation is built on top of the C API; so 
       the C API must be included even in a pure C++ project.


Installing FeabhOS
------------------

The following steps must be performed to use FeabhOS in your project

********************************************************************
NOTE:
    FEABHOS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE UNDERLYING OPERATING
    SYSTEM.  YOU MUST HAVE THE APPROPRIATE OS INSTALLED
    IN YOUR PROJECT BEFORE ADDING FEABHOS.

*********************************************************************

1.  Set up additional include paths.
    For C projects:
        feabhOS\C\common\inc
        feabhOS\C\<PLATFORM>\inc
       
    For C++ projects you must also add:
        feabhOS\C++\inc


2.  Add the feabhOS source files to your project.
    For C projects:
        feabhOS\C\<PLATFORM>\src\*.c  [REQUIRED]
        feabhOS\C\common\inc\*.h      [OPTIONAL]

    For C++ project you must add the following files:
        feabhOS\C++\src\*.cpp         [REQUIRED]
        feabhOS\C++\inc\*.h           [OPTIONAL]


3.  Rebuild your system.
